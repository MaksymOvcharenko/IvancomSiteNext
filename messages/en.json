We have already survived the pandemic, and now, as much as we can, we help the Armed Forces of Ukraine accelerate victory. Throughout all this time, we have been actively volunteering and supporting not only the army but also people and even animals – because for us, it is important to be humane, to provide care and support to everyone who needs it.\n\nJoin our IVANCOM family and share our belief in Ukraine's bright future!",
