Send parcels there via Nova Poshta: Lviv region, Hostynceve, branch №1 (Up to 1000 kg and dimensions up to 70 cm x 170 cm x 300 cm) Recipient: FOP Kisil Ludmila Anatoliivna EDPRPOU: 3221718269 +380 (95) 801-04-74"
      },
      "question2": {
        "question": "How do we calculate the delivery time of a parcel from Ukraine abroad?",
        "answer": "The delivery time is calculated from the moment your parcel leaves our warehouse in Ukraine (Hostynceve, Lviv region). The minimum time is from 2 days (we work without days off)."
      },
      "question3": {
        "question": "Is my parcel insured, and how much does it cost?",
        "answer": "Of course! All parcels from Ukraine to Poland are insured, and the insurance fee is 3% of the declared value. All parcels from Poland to Ukraine are insured, and the insurance fee is 1% of the declared value. This is a mandatory insurance fee that protects your parcel."
      },
      "question4": {
        "question": "How to reduce the cost of shipping from Ukraine?",
        "answer": "If your parcel is packed at the post office, carefully control whether the package dimensions match the actual dimensions of your parcel! Every extra centimeter adds costs :( Ask the operator to cut the box if it is too big. Yes, you have the right to do this! How to cut the box yourself, see this video!"
      },
      "question5": {
        "question": "Who has to pay for shipping?",
        "answer": "If the parcel is traveling from Ukraine, it can be paid for by either the recipient or the sender. If the parcel is traveling to Ukraine, only the sender pays."
      },

        "question": "What cannot be transported from Ukraine to the European Union?",
        "answer": "Alcohol, tobacco (in all its forms), electronic cigarettes, precious metals, money, meat products and lard, dairy products, fish caviar, fur products, and more. Parcels containing prohibited substances or items are returned to the sender at an additional cost."
      },
      "question7": {
        "question": "Can I send an expensive parcel to Ukraine?",
        "answer": "If the value of the parcel exceeds 1000 PLN, the sender pays an additional 10% of the difference. How do we calculate? Example: 1500 PLN - 1000 PLN = 500 PLN × 10% = 50 PLN (surcharge). This amount is added to the tariff price."
      },
      "question8": {
        "question": "How to order a parcel from a Ukrainian online store and deliver it to Europe?",
        "answer": "When buying a product from an online store, enter these delivery details: Nova Poshta, Lviv region, Hostynceve, branch №1 (Up to 1000 kg and dimensions up to 70 cm x 170 cm x 300 cm).

    "contentTeam": "Since opening our first office in Krakow on December 2, 2020, IVANCOM has grown into a true family where everyone finds support and understanding. We help send parcels to Ukraine, organize the delivery of medicines, documents, and goods, provide pet transportation, relocations, and other logistics services.\n\nDuring this time, our team has grown to over 40 employees, we have 5 stationary branches in Poland (Katowice, Krakow, Warsaw, Wroclaw, and Gdansk), several mobile branches, our own fleet, and a sorting base in Ukraine. We have already survived the pandemic, and now, as much as we can, we help the Armed Forces of Ukraine accelerate victory. Throughout all this time, we have been actively volunteering and supporting not only the army but also people and even animals – because for us, it is important to be humane, to provide care and support to everyone who needs it.\n\nJoin our IVANCOM family and share our belief in Ukraine's bright future!",

    "part1Strong": "Helping is not just charity; it's a way to be there during the most difficult moments. IVANCOM began its path of volunteering back in 2019, when we supported orphanages, helped animals in shelters, and collected humanitarian aid for those who found themselves in difficult life situations.",
    "part2Strong": "When dark times came for Ukraine, we did not stand aside. During the first days of the full-scale war, our team organized the evacuation of women, children, and the elderly from hotspots, provided assistance to displaced people, and delivered humanitarian aid to the most dangerous regions. We raised funds to purchase vehicles, military equipment, thermal imagers, and medicines for our defenders.",
    "part3Strong": "But volunteering is not only about helping during wartime. It’s about continuously caring for those in need. We support children's hospitals, help people in need, organize donation drives for displaced persons, and feed animals in shelters. We know that every good deed matters.",
